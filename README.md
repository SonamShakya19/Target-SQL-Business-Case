Target SQL — Business Case is an end-to-end SQL analysis of Target’s Brazil e-commerce dataset. Using BigQuery/standard SQL I cleaned and joined eight tables (orders, customers, products, payments, sellers, reviews, geolocation, order_items) to uncover order and seasonal trends, regional revenue and freight patterns, delivery performance, and customer sentiment — then turned those findings into clear, data-driven recommendations to improve logistics and product strategy. The project showcases practical skills in data cleaning, complex joins, time-series and cohort analysis, and communicating technical results as business actions.
